# Overview

The Java 15 was released at 09/2020 and the main features are:

## [Sealed Class](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/360)

Enhance the Java programming language with sealed classes and interfaces.

Sealed classes and interfaces restrict which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement
them.

## [Pattern Matching](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/375)

Enhance the Java programming language with pattern matching for the instanceof operator.

Pattern matching allows common logic in a program, namely the conditional extraction of components
from objects, to be expressed more concisely and safely. This is a preview language feature in JDK

15.

## [Records](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/384)

Enhance the Java programming language with records, which are classes that act as transparent
carriers for immutable data. Records can be thought of as nominal tuples.
